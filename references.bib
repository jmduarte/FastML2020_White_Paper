               microscopy (MFM) has become a truly widespread and commonly used
               characterization technique that has been applied to a variety of
               research and industrial applications. Some of the main
               advantages of the method includes its high spatial resolution
               (typically ?50 nm), ability to work in variable temperature and
               applied magnetic fields, versatility, and simplicity in
               operation, all without almost any need for sample preparation.
               However, for most commercial systems, the technique has
               historically provided only qualitative information, and the
               number of available modes was typically limited, thus not
               reflecting the experimental demands. Additionally, the range of
               samples under study was largely restricted to ?classic?
               ferromagnetic samples (typically, thin films or patterned
               nanostructures). Throughout this Perspective article, the recent
               progress and development of MFM is described, followed by a
               summary of the current state-of-the-art techniques and objects

               discussed in the context of emerging instrumental and material

               electrochemical potentials at the nanometer scale; however, it
               offers little information on local charge dynamics. Here, we
               implement a hyperspectral KPFM approach for spatially mapping
               bias-dependent charge dynamics in timescales ranging from the
               sub-millisecond to the second regime. As a proof of principle,

  abstract  = "Fast, high-resolution mapping of heterogeneous interfaces with a
               wide elastic modulus range is a major goal of atomic force
               microscopy (AFM). This goal becomes more challenging when the
               nanomechanical mapping involves biomolecules in their native
               environment. Over the years, several AFM-based methods have been
               developed to address this goal. However, none of these methods
               combine sub-nanometer spatial resolution, quantitative accuracy,
               fast data acquisition speed, wide elastic modulus range and
               operation in physiological solutions. Here, we present detailed
               procedures for generating high-resolution maps of the elastic
               properties of biomolecules and polymers using bimodal AFM. This
               requires the simultaneous excitation of the first two eigenmodes
               of the cantilever. An amplitude modulation (AM) feedback acting
               on the first mode controls the tip-sample distance, and a
               frequency modulation (FM) feedback acts on the second mode. The
               method is fast because the elastic modulus, deformation and
               topography images are obtained simultaneously. The method is
               efficient because only a single data point per pixel is needed
               to generate the aforementioned images. The main stages of the
               bimodal imaging are sample preparation, calibration of the
               instrument, tuning of the microscope and generation of the
               nanomechanical maps. In addition, with knowledge of the
               deformation, bimodal AFM enables reconstruction of the true
               topography of the surface. It takes ~9 h to complete the whole
               procedure.",

              Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large

              based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or
              chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased
              interpretation. The interpretability of machine-learning results
              in materials science, specifically materials' functionalities,
              can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data
              handling. The use of techniques such as dimensional stacking can
              provide the much needed physical and chemical constraints, while
              proper understanding of the assumptions imposed by model
              parameters can help avoid overinterpretation. These concepts are
              illustrated by application to recently reported ferroelectric

              systematic analysis and introduction of physical constraints, it

              exotic mechanisms previously suggested, but rather well described

               of up to 15 type III domains that play critical roles in cell
               binding and self-assembly. Here, we use single-molecule force

               We found that the native FNIII region displays strong mechanical
               unfolding hierarchies requiring 80 pN of force to unfold the
               weakest domain and 200 pN for the most stable domain. In an

               of better instrumentation platforms, probes, and novel
               spectroscopic measurements; however, many opportunities related
               to data processing and acquisition in SPM are just being
               realized now. This chapter will describe the recent progress in
               data-driven SPM by giving a broad overview of the field, the
               foundation of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the
               atomic force microscope (AFM), as well as a description behind
               the operating principles and dynamic modes. A comprehensive
               overview of the multi-frequency techniques, Band excitation, and
               general acquisition mode SPM is given, setting the context for
               the application of big data, machine learning, and artificial
               intelligence in the field of dynamic SPM.",

              data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are
              beginning to take shape within materials science. These
              approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable
              rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct
              experimentation or by computations/simulations in which
              fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric
              informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material
              properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional
              methods---due to the cost, time or effort involved---but for
              which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for
              at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are
              typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material
              numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via
              a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of
              interest. Fingerprints, also referred to as ``descriptors'', may
              be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application
              domain and needs. Predictions may also be
              extrapolative---extending into new materials spaces---provided
              prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This
              article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent
              successful data-driven ``materials informatics'' strategies
              undertaken in the last decade, with particular emphasis on the
              fingerprint or descriptor choices. The review also identifies

               computer-aided design (CAD) virtual 3D models into physical
               objects. By digital slicing of CAD, 3D scan, or tomography data,
               AM builds objects layer by layer without the need for molds or
               machining. AM enables decentralized fabrication of customized
               objects on demand by exploiting digital information storage and
               retrieval via the Internet. The ongoing transition from rapid
               prototyping to rapid manufacturing prompts new challenges for
               mechanical engineers and materials scientists alike. Because
               polymers are by far the most utilized class of materials for AM,
               this Review focuses on polymer processing and the development of
               polymers and advanced polymer systems specifically for AM. AM
               techniques covered include vat photopolymerization
               (stereolithography), powder bed fusion (SLS), material and
               binder jetting (inkjet and aerosol 3D printing), sheet
               lamination (LOM), extrusion (FDM, 3D dispensing, 3D fiber
               deposition, and 3D plotting), and 3D bioprinting. The range of
               polymers used in AM encompasses thermoplastics, thermosets,
               elastomers, hydrogels, functional polymers, polymer blends,
               composites, and biological systems. Aspects of polymer design,
               additives, and processing parameters as they relate to enhancing
               build speed and improving accuracy, functionality, surface
               finish, stability, mechanical properties, and porosity are
               addressed. Selected applications demonstrate how polymer-based
               AM is being exploited in lightweight engineering, architecture,
               food processing, optics, energy technology, dentistry, drug
               delivery, and personalized medicine. Unparalleled by metals and
               ceramics, polymer-based AM plays a key role in the emerging AM
               of advanced multifunctional and multimaterial systems including

                   method has enabled mapping of the structure and
                   functionality of solids on the atomic scale, yielding
                   information-rich data sets containing information on the
                   interatomic electric and magnetic fields, structural and
                   electronic order parameters, and other symmetry breaking
                   distortions. A critical bottleneck on the pathway toward
                   harnessing 4D-STEM for materials exploration is the dearth
                   of analytical tools that can reduce complex 4D-STEM data
                   sets to physically relevant descriptors. Classical machine
                   learning (ML) methods such as principal component analysis
                   and other linear unmixing techniques are limited by the
                   presence of multiple point-group symmetric variants, where
                   diffractograms from each rotationally equivalent position
                   will form its own component. This limitation even holds for
                   more complex ML methods, such as convolutional neural
                   networks. Here, we propose and implement an approach for the
                   systematic exploration of symmetry breaking phenomena from
                   4D-STEM data sets using rotationally invariant variational
                   autoencoders (rrVAE), which is designed to disentangle the
                   general rotation of the object from other latent
                   representations. The implementation of purely rotational
                   rrVAE is discussed as are applications to simulated data for
                   graphene and zincblende structures that illustrate the
                   effect of site symmetry breaking. Finally, the rrVAE
                   analysis of 4D-STEM data of vacancies in graphene is
                   illustrated and compared to the classical center-of-mass
                   (COM) analysis. This approach is universal for probing of
                   symmetry breaking phenomena in complex systems and can be
                   implemented for a broad range of diffraction methods
                   exploring the 2D diffraction space of the system, including
                   X-ray ptychography, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD),

               microchannels and microvasculature at room temperature by
               direct-writing liquid metal as a sacrificial template. The
               formation of a surface oxide skin on the low-viscosity liquid
               metal stabilizes the shape of the printed metal for planar and
               out-of-plane structures. The printed structures can be embedded
               in a variety of soft (e.g. elastomeric) and rigid (e.g.
               thermoset) polymers. Both acid and electrochemical reduction are
               capable of removing the oxide skin that forms on the metal,
               which destabilizes the ink so that it withdraws from the
               encapsulating material due to capillary forces, resulting in
               nearly full recovery of the fugitive ink at room temperature.
               Whereas conventional fabrication procedures typically confine
               microchannels to 2D planes, the geometry of the printed
               microchannels can be varied from a simple 2D network to complex
               3D architectures without using lithography. The method produces
               robust monolithic structures without the need for any bonding or
               assembling techniques that often limit the materials of
               construction of conventional microchannels. Removing select
               portions of the metal leaves behind 3D metal features that can
               be used as antennas, interconnects, or electrodes for
               interfacing with lab-on-a-chip devices. This paper describes the

               a critical nanofabrication technique that enables fine-tuning of
               atomic structure and thickness as a result of its layer-by-layer
               growth behavior. In this study, in situ X-ray absorption spectra
               of the S K-edge during ALD growth of ZnS thin films on TiO2
               nanoparticles were collected and analyzed. The experimental
               results show that both sulfide and sulfate species form during
               the nucleation phase of ZnS on TiO2. As film growth proceeds,
               the S K-edge of the in situ ZnS film converges to that of a
               representative ex situ ALD ZnS film. By building representative
               atomistic models, a high-throughput screening method was
               developed to determine the most probable atomic configurations
               as the film structure evolves. The screening method consisted of
               a supervised machine learning analysis of thousands of simulated

               Atomic-level insight was gained into changes in the coordination

                   errors can lead to significant deviations from the true,

  abstract = "Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from
              measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse
              identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one
              approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although
              extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or
              dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are
              extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI
              (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to
              identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The
              SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and
              a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the
              ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial
              differential equations and conservation laws from limited and
              noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is
              several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous
              approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE

               approaches. Monitoring of complex, heterogeneous systems may be
               problematic because of sampling hardware limitations, and many
               relevant analytes (neutrals) exhibit poor ESI performance. An
               alternative monitoring strategy addressing this significant
               impasse is condensed phase membrane introduction mass
               spectrometry using liquid electron ionization (CP-MIMS-LEI). In
               CP-MIMS, a semipermeable silicone membrane selects hydrophobic
               neutral analytes, rejecting particulates and charged chemical
               components. Analytes partition through the membrane, and are
               then transported to the LEI interface for sequential
               nebulization, vaporization, and ionization. CP-MIMS and LEI are

               science toolbox in recent years is machine learning. This
               collection of statistical methods has already proved to be
               capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied
               research. At present, we are witnessing an explosion of works
               that develop and apply machine learning to solid-state systems.
               We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most
               recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce
               machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and
               databases in materials science. We continue with the description
               of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of
               stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure.
               Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative
               structure--property relationships and various approaches for the
               replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We
               review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can
               be applied to improve the rational design process and related
               examples of applications. Two major questions are always the
               interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from
               machine learning models. We consider therefore the different
               facets of interpretability and their importance in materials
               science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths

It exhibits traditional astronomy broker features such as automatized ingestion, annotation, selection, and redistribution of promising alerts for transient science. It is also designed to go beyond traditional broker features by providing real-time transient classification that is continuously improved by using state-of-the-art deep learning and adaptive learning techniques. These evolving added values will enable more accurate scientific output from LSST photometric data for diverse science cases while also leading to a higher incidence of new discoveries which shall accompany the evolution of the survey. In this paper, we introduce fink, its science motivation, architecture, and current status including first science verification cases using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream.}",

	abstract = {We apply a machine learning algorithm, the artificial neural network, to the search for gravitational-wave signals associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The multi-dimensional samples consisting of data corresponding to the statistical and physical quantities from the coherent search pipeline are fed into the artificial neural network to distinguish simulated gravitational-wave signals from background noise artifacts. Our result shows that the data classification efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability (FAP) is improved by the artificial neural network in comparison to the conventional detection statistic. Specifically, the distance at 50% detection probability at a fixed false positive rate is increased about 8%–14% for the considered waveform models. We also evaluate a few seconds of the gravitational-wave data segment using the trained networks and obtain the FAP. We suggest that the artificial neural network can be a complementary method to the conventional detection statistic for identifying gravitational-wave signals related to the short GRBs.}

	abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a popular and powerful approach for solving problems in astrophysics. We review applications of machine learning techniques for the analysis of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector data. Examples include techniques for improving the sensitivity of Advanced Laser Interferometer GW Observatory and Advanced Virgo GW searches, methods for fast measurements of the astrophysical parameters of GW sources, and algorithms for reduction and characterization of non-astrophysical detector noise. These applications demonstrate how machine learning techniques may be harnessed to enhance the science that is possible with current and future GW detectors.}

	abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves has inaugurated the era of gravitational astronomy and opened new avenues for the multimessenger study of cosmic sources. Thanks to their sensitivity, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers will probe a much larger volume of space and expand the capability of discovering new gravitational wave emitters. The characterization of these detectors is a primary task in order to recognize the main sources of noise and optimize the sensitivity of interferometers. Glitches are transient noise events that can impact the data quality of the interferometers and their classification is an important task for detector characterization. Deep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits convolutional neural networks to classify glitches starting from their time-frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization.}

The project is now in an advanced construction phase and the assembly and integration will be completed by the end of 2015. Advanced Virgo will be part of a network, alongside the two Advanced LIGO detectors in the US and GEO HF in Germany, with the goal of contributing to the early detection of gravitational waves and to opening a new window of observation on the universe. In this paper we describe the main features of the Advanced Virgo detector and outline the status of the construction.}

We review the performance of these techniques and show how they have influenced the upgrades of other detectors worldwide. In the second half of the paper, we consider how GEO 600 continues to pioneer new techniques for future gravitational wave detectors. We describe some of the new methods in detail and present new results on how they improve the sensitivity and/or the stability of GEO 600 and possibly of future detectors.}

	abstract = {The Level-1 trigger system (TRG) in the Belle II experiment is designed to summarize real-time sub-detectors information by using FPGA chips for the central data acquisition (DAQ) system, and it includes several sub-trigger systems for triggering various types of physics events in interest. The main focus in this report is CDCTRG: the track trigger system with Central Drift Chamber (CDC) detector, which is responsible for the real-time trajectory reconstruction of charged particles with various algorithms: Track-Segment Finder, 2D, 3D, Neuro-3D, and short tracking. CDCTRG is necessary for specific types of physics, such as hadronic and μ pair. This paper will introduce the design of the hardware system and algorithm implementation in FPGAs. Development, validation and performance of each CDCTRG module during SuperKEKB beam collision operation will also be discussed in detail.}

	abstract = {Machine learning methods are integrated into the pipelined first level (L1) track trigger of the upgraded flavor physics experiment Belle II at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The novel triggering techniques cope with the severe background from events outside the small collision region provided by the new SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider. Using the precise drift-time information of the central drift chamber which provides axial and stereo wire layers, a neural network L1 trigger estimates the 3D track parameters of tracks, based on input from the axial wire planes provided by a 2D track finder. An extension of this 2D Hough track finder to a 3D finder is proposed, where the single hit representations in the Hough plane are trained using Monte Carlo. This 3D finder improves the track finding efficiency by including the stereo sense wires as input. The estimated polar track angle allows a specialization of the subsequent neural networks to sectors in the polar angle.}

abstract = {In recent years, spurred on by the development and availability of programmable NICs, end hosts have increasingly become the enforcement point for core network functions such as load balancing, congestion control, and application specific network offloads. However, implementing custom designs on programmable NICs is not easy: many potential bottlenecks can impact performance.This paper focuses on the performance implication of PCIe, the de-facto I/O interconnect in contemporary servers, when interacting with the host architecture and device drivers. We present a theoretical model for PCIe and pcie-bench, an open-source suite, that allows developers to gain an accurate and deep understanding of the PCIe substrate. Using pcie-bench, we characterize the PCIe subsystem in modern servers. We highlight surprising differences in PCIe implementations, evaluate the undesirable impact of PCIe features such as IOMMUs, and show the practical limits for common network cards operating at 40Gb/s and beyond. Furthermore, through pcie-bench we gained insights which guided software and future hardware architectures for both commercial and research oriented network cards and DMA engines.},
